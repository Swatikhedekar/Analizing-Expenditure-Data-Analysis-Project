# Expenditure Data Analysis Project
## Problem statement 
No business can survive in this competitive market without 
managing their cost. It does not matter if revenues are high but if 
cost is higher it is a red flag. So you are tasked to help 
management in creating and establishing new structure and 
models to reduce cost.
Do ETL : Extract-Transform-Load the dataset and find for me 
some information from this large data. This is form of data mining.
The dataset as listed on NITI Aayog website from 1980_81 to 2015_16
What all information can be achieved by mining this data, would be
brainstormed by the interns
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes. 
Do your own research and come up with your findings.

## Dataset:

## Introduction 
An Expenditure Data Analysis is the project related to Exploratory data analysis(EDA)and Data visualization of expenditure dataset from NITI Aayog of India. I used python libraries to get expenditure information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally I worked at a few ways of analyzing the spending of expenditure based on its previous performance history statewise in India.
First extract dataset, prepared data, clean ,load and transform into Power BI desktop Then creating an interactive insightful dashboard and publish on novypro. To make prediction and better decision.
